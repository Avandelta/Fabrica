## Exception

Current array of exceptions can't be fixed either by developer team of pack nor developers of modifications.

### Exception: Recipes w/out ID

- When viewing recipes for items/blocks inside game, you will find recipes that can't be deleted w/ CraftTweaker 2 and don't have an ID.

- Recipes w/out ID are an error of the recipe engine of Minecraft itself and aren't element of the gameplay (the recipe does not work).
